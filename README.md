### What it does:
It scrapes data from DogsInDanger.com and posts a random dog in danger of euthanization, raising awareness and increasing the chances of adoption. It grabs the location of the adoption center and includes appropriate hashtags to give Twitter users who live in the state a higher chance to view.

It also posts every few hours a memorial tribute to a fallen dog (name and picture), who never got the chance to a better life.

### Why I created the bot 🤖: 
As an animal lover, it pains me to see countless dogs in shelters with uncertain futures. Determined to help anyway I can, I channeled my passion for programming to create this twitter bot. As a junior developer, I have troubles finding valuable project ideas and figured something like this not only helps me grow my skills but can help make a difference.

My mission and seeking support: I genuinely believe that every small effort counts. If you're also passionate about animal welfare, I'd greatly appreciate your support—be it feedback, suggestions, or even spreading the word.

By joining forces, we can make a tangible impact in giving these voiceless creatures the love and care they deserve. 💙

Thank you for taking the time to read about my project! 🐶💟
